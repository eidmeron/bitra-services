== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Bitra Services account? =

Yes, you need an active Bitra Services account to use this plugin. Visit https://bitraservices.se to create an account.

= Where do I find my form token? =

Log in to your Bitra dashboard, go to Forms, and copy the public token for the form you want to embed.

= Can I embed multiple forms? =

Yes! You can embed as many forms as you want on different pages using different tokens.

= Is the form data secure? =

Yes, all data is processed and stored securely on Bitra servers. Your WordPress site only embeds the form - no sensitive data is stored locally.

= Can I customize the form appearance? =

* **iframe** (recommended): Form loads in an iframe, completely isolated. Best for most use cases.
* **ajax**: Form content is loaded directly into the page. May have styling conflicts but integrates better visually.
